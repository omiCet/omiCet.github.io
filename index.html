								Hi, I'm Ian, a physics major at Cornell with a passion for astronomy & planetary science. I am specifically 
								interested in the use of atmospheric forward models to inform our interpretation of transmission spectrum data, 
								allowing us to accurately characterize exoplanets.

							<p>
								<b>Research Interests:</b> photochemistry, atmospheric models, transmission spectroscopy

								<b>Fun facts about me:</b>
								<br>
								* My very first Wikipedia edit was on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Jupiter">hot Jupiter</a> page! 
								I selected the artist's impression of an ultra-hot Jupiter for the page (replacing an AI-generated image).
								<br>
								* Outside of school and research, I play clarinet. I also practice kendo, a martial art and sport, and currently 
								serve as the co-president of my university's kendo club.

								<b>Disequilibrium Retrieval for WASP-39b</b><br>The 2023 detection of photochemically produced sulfur 
								dioxide in the atmosphere of WASP-39b revealed that the effects of disequilibrium processes on the compositions 
								of exoplanets can be significant. Failing to account for such processes in atmospheric retrievals can lead to biased 
								estimates of the carbon-to-oxygen ratio and metallicity, which are key to understanding planet formation. <b>Using 
								chemical kinetics modeling, I am working on incorporating disequilibrium retrievals into the retrieval code POSEIDON, 
								and benchmarking this technique on the full JWST dataset for WASP-39b.</b>

								<b>Outreach:</b> As part of Science Olympiad at Cornell, I volunteer for Science Olympiad competitions, in which middle 
								and high school students compete in various science- and engineering-related tasks. Typically, I volunteer by 
								writing tests on astronomy topics (the topic for 2023-2025 was exoplanets!), which engage students to think like a 
								scientist in answering questions about astronomical objects and techniques.
